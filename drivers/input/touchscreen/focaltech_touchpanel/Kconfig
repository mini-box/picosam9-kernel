	help
	  Say Y here if you have a touchscreen interface using the
	  FocalTech_FT5X06 controller, and your board-specific
	  setup code includes that in its table of I2C devices.

	  If unsure, say N (but it's safe to say "Y").

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ft5x06_ts.
